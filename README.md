# Android_App-Lifecycle

This is the android application which shows and implements the different lifecycle calls in the android app. The application displays the current thread counter which increments on the re-start of each activity in the application. The thread counter value is also recovered when the main activity starts if the application was previously killed by the OS so that the progress so far is not lost.
